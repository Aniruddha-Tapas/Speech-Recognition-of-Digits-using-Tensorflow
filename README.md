# Speech Recognition of Digits using Tensorflow

This repository demonstrates a Tensorflow implementation of  Speech Recognition.
We build an LSTM recurrent neural network using the TFLearn high level Tensorflow-based library to train
on a labeled dataset of spoken digits. Then we test it on spoken digits. 

Dependencies
============
1. tensorflow  (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html)
2. tflearn (http://tflearn.org/)
3. future

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies

Usage
===========

`python demo.py`

* Run the following code in terminal. 
* This downloads the dataset into the 'data' folder and initiates the training process.
* It will take a couple hours to train fully.
* You can then test the trained model on your own .wav samples of spoken digits.
